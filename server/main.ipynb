Many businesses were forced to shut down, while others witnessed a significant decline in sales. The move aimed to curb black money and terrorism financing, but its effectiveness in achieving these goals remains uncertain.', \"The Reserve Bank of India played a pivotal role in executing the demonetization drive, withdrawing legal tender status from high-denomination banknotes of Rs 500 and Rs 1000, seizing 86% of the country's currency stock, and distributing the new Rs 2000 note.\", 'The economic impact of demonetization was felt across various sectors as the sudden withdrawal of high denomination notes resulted in a severe cash crunch affecting small businesses and daily transactions. GDP growth slowed down, and the economic output contracted in the quarter following the note ban. Additionally, inflation increased as supply chain disruptions and reduced consumer spending led to higher price levels.', 'The demonetization drive received mixed reactions from the public with some perceiving it as a necessary step towards curbing black money while others viewed it as a chaotic and poorly executed move causing widespread inconvenience.', 'The long term effects of demonetization have far-reaching consequences, including the stifling of entrepreneurship, increased informal economy, and suppressed economic growth, leading to a lopsided development, where the formal economy and financial sector remain underdeveloped, while the informal sector grows, resulting in a perpetuation of poverty and inequality.']\n"
